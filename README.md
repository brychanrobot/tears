# 👅 Tears — Real-Time Collaborative Taste Tests & Tier Lists

**Tears** is a collaborative, real-time tier list platform specifically engineered for taste tests (Trader Joe's snacks, craft beers, dips, hot sauces, coffee beans, and takeout showdowns).

Most online tier list makers are clunky, desktop-only, and lack real-time synchronization. Tears provides an effortless, mobile-friendly experience designed for tasting nights with friends or partners.
